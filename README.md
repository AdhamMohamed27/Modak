# 🎵 Modak

**Modak** is a cross-platform app that uses machine learning to detect your current emotion from your facial expression and creates Spotify playlists that match your mood. Whether you're feeling happy, sad, energetic, or relaxed — Modak tailors music that resonates with your feelings.

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Emotion Detection**  
   Using a machine learning model, the app captures a photo of your face and analyzes your current emotional state (e.g. happy, sad, angry, surprised).

2. **Spotify Playlist Generation**  
   Based on the detected emotion, Modak fetches your top Spotify tracks and curates a playlist that fits your mood using the Spotify Web API.

3. **Personalized Experience**  
   Your Spotify account is securely linked, and all generated playlists are saved under your profile.
